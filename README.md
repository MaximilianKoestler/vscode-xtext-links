# xtext-links README

With this extension you can open links from the terminal that are formatted the way that Xtext
produces warnings/errors.

## Features

Links in the terminal that include Xtext-style line and column information now open a file at the
correct position when you click on them.

### Example Link
```
ERROR:Something has gone wrong. (file:/C:/SomeDir/src/main.mydsl line : 30 column : 4)
                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```
